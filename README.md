# Loan Approval Prediction: Supervised Learning

## Description
This project explores the use of supervised classification algorithms to the problem of loan approval prediction. The goal is to determine whether a loan application will be approved or not, based on applicant information. 

An initial Exploratory Data Analysis is done to understand the dataset and identify class distribution.

By preprocessing loan datasets and training of multiple machine learning models, the project aims to accurately classify loan applications while evaluating model performance through different metrics.
